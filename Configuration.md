# Configuration of OpenMSC #

This section explains how to configure OpenMSC. The emulator requires two configuration files, i.e.:
  * openmsc.cfg
  * openmsc.msc

The MSCgen file is described in [MSCgen File Convention](https://code.google.com/p/openmsc/wiki/Configuration_MSCgen_File_Convention). In order to provide environmental details, openmsc.cfg allows the user to set variables, e.g., number of UEs and BSs.
